Hii team

✅ Solution (Choose any one)
🔥 FIX 1 — BEST (Rename the folder before importing)

Windows Explorer me folder ka naam change karo:

college_management_system  -->  college_management_system_v1


Then Eclipse me:

File → Import → Maven → Existing Maven Project → Select new folder

✔ This will work 100%.

🔥 FIX 2 — Remove old project from Eclipse workspace

Eclipse → Project Explorer

Right-click on old project:

college_management_system


Select Delete

In popup →
✔ Do NOT check "Delete from disk"
(sirf workspace se remove hoga)

Now re-import project.

🔥 FIX 3 — Change workspace

Eclipse new workspace pe open karo:

File → Switch Workspace → Other...


New empty workspace choose karo → project import karo.

💡 Why this is happening?

Because Eclipse workspace structure is like this:

workspace/
   college_management_system/   <-- already exists


And you are trying to import the same named project again, so Eclipse blocks it.

If you want, send me the workspace path
